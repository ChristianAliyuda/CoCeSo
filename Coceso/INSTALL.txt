INSTALL GUIDE:

1. REQUIRED SYSTEM
Server:
- Java JRE (version 1.6 and newer tested)
- Tomcat (version 7 and newer tested)
- PostgreSQL DB (9.1 and newer tested)
- Maven (Build Manager)
Client:
- Web Browser (full features only in Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome tested)

2. INSTALLATION
- Set up a database for the project
- Write your DB login data to src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/coceso.properties
- Execute src/db_files/create.sql on the database
- Execute YOUR MODIFIED create_operator.sql on the database
- Build the project via Maven (i.e. ´mvn package´)
- Load the project into Tomcat
- Navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080/coceso

On first login, the password used for login will NOT be validated, but set in the DB. After the password was set (for the
user created in 'create_operator.sql), change the flag 'firstUse' in coceso.properties to false.
After the next restart (or redeployment) the afore set password will be accepted only. The first user has
superuser privileges and can add new users and set their passwords.
